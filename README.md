# Dashmips

Mips Interpreter Program

## Adding Syscalls / Adding Instructions
You can add to the existing files in the `dashmips/instructions` and `dashmips/syscalls` directories using the relevant decorator (`@`).
If you add instructions or syscalls to a new file in these subdirectories ensure that it is named `*_instructions.py` or `*_syscalls.py` where `*` is whatever identifier you choose.
